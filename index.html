<h1 id="human-thriving">Human Thriving</h1>

<p>Some humans want to thrive/flourish.</p>

<p>Our definition of thriving: &ldquo;the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.&rdquo; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:how-of-happiness"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:how-of-happiness">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Thriving is really just a fancy word for high well-being. I love the word thriving. I most associate the word with Good Ventures. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:good-ventures"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:good-ventures">2</a></sup></p>

<p>Well-being comprises a) short-term pleasant and unpleasant feelings and b) your overall satisfaction with your life. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:diener-1993"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:diener-1993">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Ben Todd, the CEO of Effective Altruist organization 80,000 Hours, noted that “most effective altruists care about increasing the number of ‘WALYs’ or well-being adjusted life years, where health is just one component of wellbeing.” <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:ben-walys"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:ben-walys">4</a></sup></p>

<h1 id="thriving-is-a-high-value-cause">Thriving is a high value cause</h1>

<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>~7 billion people suffer from ordinary human unhappiness or a lack of thriving. As a complete guess, if a year “thriving” was 30% better than a year in full health but not “thriving” and 60% of humanity is not thriving, then we have ~1.3 billion DALYs per year. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:personal-approx"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:personal-approx">5</a></sup> More research would be useful to give better estimates here.</p>

<p>It could be possible that a year &ldquo;thriving&rdquo; more than doubles positive affect and life satisfaction.</p>

<h2 id="neglectedness">Neglectedness</h2>

<p>Seems to be massive amounts of indirect spend here, both by consumers and funders. i.e. work done on US education philanthropy is arguably for the goal of a more thriving population, at least in part.</p>

<p>Seems to be little direct investment on high-integrity thriving research.</p>

<p>Seems to be little direct investment into high effect size interventions for inducing &ldquo;human thriving&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="solvability">Solvability</h2>

<p>Unsure.</p>

<h1 id="strategies">Strategies</h1>

<p>Promising approaches pass the test: &ldquo;Without thing X, the % odds that we will have billions more &ldquo;thriving-life-years&rdquo; within 30 years is dramatically lower.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="improving-allocation-indirectly">Improving allocation indirectly</h2>

<h3 id="anti-poverty-well-being-plant-post">Anti-poverty well-being [^plant-post]</h3>

<p>Plant points out that certain anti-poverty work may not help well-being. [^plant-post] Further research here may prompt donors that care about well-being to consider additional routes. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:plant-paper"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:plant-paper">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Seems high leverage.</p>

<h3 id="improve-daly-score-plant-paper">Improve DALY score <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:plant-paper"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:plant-paper">7</a></sup></h3>

<p>&ldquo;QALYs/DALYs very likely underrate the badness of mental health conditions on happiness. First, they are measures of health, not happiness. Second, their weighting are creating by asking people how bad they expect various conditions to be, rather than assessing asking people with those conditions to report their subjective well-being. As mental health conditions are hard to imagine and hard to adapt to, their are underrated. As a estimate that can definitely be argued about, they might be 10-18 times worse than we imagine them to be.&rdquo; [^plant-post]</p>

<p>Using subjective well-being scores and the method used by DALY scoring for moderate anxiety or depression vs &lsquo;some difficulty walking,&rsquo; Plant makes a case that &ldquo;moderate anxiety or depression is about 18 worse for happiness than we imagine it to be.&rdquo; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:plant-paper"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:plant-paper">8</a></sup></p>

<h3 id="daly-alternatives">DALY alternatives</h3>

<p><a href="https://whatworkswellbeing.org/2015/04/23/exploring-a-wellbeing-adjusted-life-year-welby/">WELBY</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5016960/">WALY</a></p>

<p>Why is this important? For most, <a href="http://effective-altruism.com/ea/pu/we_care_about_walys_not_qalys/">maximizing good involves maximizing well-being adjusted life years.</a></p>

<p>Seems high leverage, though improving DALY measurement is likely preferable due to the existing &ldquo;user base&rdquo;.</p>

<h3 id="positive-externalities">Positive externalities</h3>

<p>Research into positive externalities from more “thriving”/less ordinary unhappiness – e.g. Do people become more involved in their communities and help others more? Do they choose to work on more important problems? Are they more effective in their work?</p>

<p>Seems promising:</p>

<p>&ldquo;A review of all the available literature has revealed that happiness does indeed have numerous positive byproducts, which appear to benefit not only individuals, but families, communities, and the society at large (<a href="http://sonjalyubomirsky.com/wp-content/themes/sonjalyubomirsky/papers/LKD2005.pdf">Lyubomirsky, King, &amp; Diener, 2005</a>). The benefits of happiness include higher income and superior work outcomes (e.g., greater productivity and higher quality of work), larger social rewards (e.g., more satisfying and longer marriages, more friends, stronger social support, and richer social interactions), more activity, energy, and flow, and better physical health (e.g., a bolstered immune system, lowered stress levels, and less pain) and even longer life. The literature, my colleagues and I have found, also suggests that happy individuals are more creative, helpful, charitable, and self-confident, have better self-control, and show greater self-regulatory and coping abilities.&rdquo; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:sonja"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:sonja">9</a></sup></p>

<p>Evidence here could make happiness/thriving promising as a meta-cause – i.e. improve happiness, leading to people solving more problems.</p>

<h3 id="fda-condition">FDA condition</h3>

<p>Research into how hard it would be to get a treatment approved by the FDA to treat &ldquo;mild depression&rdquo; (or mild human unhappiness). What is the process here? It seems to be that anything can be prescribed for as long as there is some kind of clinical evaluation, diagnosis, etc.</p>

<p>Next step would be figuring why pharma companies haven’t done this themselves, given that pharma companies have successfully used policy work to make “mild cognitive impairment” a prescribable condition (<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/drugs-and-drug-policy-9780199764501?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;">Kleiman, Caulkins, &amp; Hawken, 2011</a>).</p>

<h3 id="expressed-interest">Expressed interest</h3>

<p>Expressing interest in funding groups in a given cause area seems to be &ldquo;a major driver of what sorts of giving opportunities [you&rsquo;re] able to find.&rdquo; <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:expressed-interest"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:expressed-interest">10</a></sup></p>

<p>This may be true at a macro level, as well. From personal conversations with researchers in adjacent fields, researchers don&rsquo;t go into / leave fields where funding is not easily available.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d expect there are more researchers with proposals they&rsquo;d love to do that they&rsquo;ve never talked about, because they feel so constrained by what funders seem to be interested in. Therefore, a broad expression of interest in potentially high impact work in this area could unearth high quality proposals and ideas.</p>

<p>A funder or individual could create a &ldquo;sourcing organization&rdquo; that requests and reviews grants, and then passes high-quality options along to the interested funders. Funders could be people in the earning to give community and philanthropists.</p>

<h2 id="high-integrity-research">High-integrity research</h2>

<h3 id="high-effect-size">High-effect size</h3>

<p>Research seeking interventions that lead to “human thriving”. Particularly research seeking high effect size small sample size methods – things to make a small number of people a lot less ordinarily unhappy. (Applying the Paul Graham <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">“do things that don’t scale”</a> approach that has worked well for startups like Airbnb).</p>

<p>The startup founder in me thinks that it could be interesting to do a &ldquo;thriving house&rdquo; where services are provided to help residents thrive.</p>

<h2 id="meta-research-integrity">Meta research integrity</h2>

<h3 id="research-quality-ai-tool">Research quality AI tool</h3>

<p>Why now: Advances in NLP may make this possible as of now.
Why care: Scientific research is highly influential in society. You could influence the influential with a project like this.</p>

<p>Challenges: Getting full text of papers to parse them. Is NLP good enough to parse the important bits?</p>

<p>What might it look like:</p>

<p>Upload full-text or input a link to free online full text, then it creates a permanent page on the site for that paper, with the quality ratings. This is also how it spreads - via SEO.</p>

<p>Other cool things:</p>

<p>Methods for grading evidence exist, see GRADE by cochrane. <a href="http://training.cochrane.org/path/grade-approach-evaluating-quality-evidence-pathway">http://training.cochrane.org/path/grade-approach-evaluating-quality-evidence-pathway</a></p>

<p>It could indicate whether the study was pre-registered, whether it shows correlation or causation, whether the study shared all of its data, whether it has been reproduced successfully/unsuccessfully. (Eventually, you could cluster results around topics/hypotheses, e.g. stereotype threat, and show total and rolling avg quality and results of research on that topic, etc)</p>

<p>You could prevent people from falling victim to thinking small sample size means low quality research. Small sample sizes with large effect sizes can be high quality.</p>

<h3 id="a-high-quality-research-prize-grant-system">A high quality research prize/grant system</h3>

<p>One way to both encourage research integrity, and to also encourage high-effect size research at the same time, is to have a source of research funds available only to research that meets the &ldquo;high-integrity test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This could use the lottery principle, and be a quarterly grant where everyone&rsquo;s research integrity is evaluated, and then everyone that meets the bar gets a small prize, and one person gets a large prize? Or something along these lines - to encourage the research without being prohibitively expensive.</p>

<h2 id="thriving-prioritization-research">Thriving prioritization research</h2>

<p>How important is thriving relative to other causes?</p>

<h3 id="more-social-time">More social time</h3>

<p>Important that there&rsquo;s a cost-effective path, so this can scale.</p>

<p>Possibility that for-profit companies will scale up foundational research. e.g. if research showed that joining a certain type of community house boosted happiness 5x, then demand for for-profit co-living compaines would rise.</p>

<p><strong>May have a <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/107692/social-time-crucial-daily-emotional-wellbeing.aspx">large effect size</a>.</strong></p>

<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>

<p>Often, but not always, through work.</p>

<p>Purpose seems important to well-being. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:80k-satisfaction"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:80k-satisfaction">11</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:sdt"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:sdt">12</a></sup></p>

<p><strong>[I&rsquo;m interested in leading research like this]()</strong></p>

<!-- should have a reference to sam's post on greg -->

<!-- other TODO, add sample press releases for each of these research things as min remarkable products -->

<h2 id="scaling-existing-interventions">Scaling existing interventions</h2>

<p>This strategy applies to mental health, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to apply to thriving.</p>

<h3 id="cbt-apps-mental-health-apps-for-the-developing-world">CBT apps / mental health apps for the developing world</h3>

<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) seems to have some promise.</p>

<p>May be interesting and cost-effective in the developing world. <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:plant-paper"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:plant-paper">14</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:gwwc-report"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:gwwc-report">15</a></sup> <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:gwwc-interventions"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:gwwc-interventions">16</a></sup></p>
